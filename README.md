# pythonlist
This repository contains Python code demonstrating basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a specific element.
# Python List Operation
1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends elements: 10, 20, 30, 40.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position of the list.
4. Extends the list with additional elements `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30` in the list.

## Code Overview

The Python code covers basic list manipulation using methods such as:

- `append()`
- `insert()`
- `extend()`
- `pop()`
- `sort()`
- `index()`
